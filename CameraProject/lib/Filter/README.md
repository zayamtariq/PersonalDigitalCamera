# Filters! 

Filters are useful if you have noisy data and want to clean it up for more precise data.

A couple of filters are implemented in this library, including:
- Kalman Filter
- Median Filter
- SMA (Simple Moving Average) Filter

Read the following header files to understand how to use them and where to learn about how they work!
- Filter.h
- KalmanFilter.h
- MedianFilter.h
- SMAFilter.h

A couple of examples on using these have also been provided in the examples folder.

For now, if you are interested on how filters work and how they can be
implemented, check out this
[c++ implementation for some common filters](https://github.com/dimembermatt/Mbed-Shared-Components/tree/main/src/Filter).
