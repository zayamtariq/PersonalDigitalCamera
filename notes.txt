lcd_readsector(returned_string) { 
	for (i = 0; i < 512; ++i) { 
		returned_string[i] = transmitted_byte; 
	}
}

now we should try with the file system. scenario: there will already exist an image on the sd card, and our goal is to display it on the lcd display. 

flow of things: 

file mount -> file count (device should always know how many files there are so that we can name next files when image is taken) -> 


stranger on internet: 

file mount -> load image control -> show image 

geldy: 

sequence is typically initialise/mount media(SD card or flash) -> load image control -> set word -> show image
